## Organs needed & provided

- Lung (provided by emouse)
- Ovary (**_not_** provided by emouse)

# 3D Models and Registration

## Lung

7 blocks positioned, the team receives the lung tissues only from JAX

![A screenshot of the lung with arrows for extraction sites](images/emouse/lung1.png)
![A second screenshot of the lung with arrows for extraction sites, dorsal view](images/emouse/lung2.png)

# Pancreas

Team is unsure who will handle pancreas registrations

# Kidney

Team has no information

Team will reach out to 5x5 team, who will provide information for kidney and pancreas

# Ovary

Need reference organ and collaborators

# Muscle

Need reference organ and collaborators
