## Data shared in February 2025
Simon shares: 3D model of female mouse - ovary, lung, kidney, and partial skeleton (for reference). Muscle coming next week.

## Overview DICOMs (8/5/24)
A stack with 275 DICOM images were shared by Simon. Andi uses bee DICOM viewer to visualize them:

## Overview 3D models (pre-August 2024)

Four STL files were provided. One is too big to easily upload to GitHub, so three models are shown [here](models/melov/). All four models show:

- whole mouse
- dense muscle (this model is too large for GitHub, so we deposited it on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dPacP1yNMPnQvoqJdwNh5rd6FNZe7Dgg?usp=sharing))
- brain at 12 months
- brain 3D, 20 IT
