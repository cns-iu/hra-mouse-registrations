**Study Purpose**: The goal of this work is to create annotated generic mouse heart scaffold for 
registration of segmented data obtained by experimental groups.

**Data Collection**: The generic scaffold is created based on the general description
and average dimensions of mouse hearts as in the literature.

**Primary Conclusion**: None stated

---
**Curatorâ€™s Notes:**

**Experimental Design:** Not applicable. 

**Completeness:** The dataset is intended to serve as a tool onto which other datasets will be mapped.

**Subjects & Samples:** The generic scaffold is not subject/sample specific but represents a generic mouse heart.

**Primary vs derivative data:** The primary folder contains the mapping tool provenance data file needed to produce the generic mouse heart scaffold. The mapping tool will be accessible from the release download page on the SPARC Portal. The derivative folder contains JSON files which are used to generate a visualization of the scaffold on the web portal.
